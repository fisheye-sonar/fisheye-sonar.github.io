        <h2>Project Context</h2>
        <p>
        The use of sonar cameras to monitor salmon returning to spawn in watersheds from Alaska to California is a
        favored
        methodology due to its accuracy, ability to work at night, in highly turbid conditions, and unlike other
        techniques,
        does not result in any fish mortality. However, the adoption of sonar is currently constrained due its annual
        operating
        cost - the video must be viewed, and the fish counted, manually.
        </p>
        <p>

        We are working to develop an affordable and automated as well as a robust and accurate system which will
        automate this process. By improving salmon monitoring, the fishery agencies
        responsible for the recovery of threatened salmon populations will be aided in their efforts, and the commercial
        management of healthy salmon populations will be better able to assure future catch rates that are sustainable.
